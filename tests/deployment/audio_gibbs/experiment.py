"""Audio Gibbs sampler test experiment.

Participants adjust a slider to make a synthesized word sound as
"dominant" or "trustworthy" as possible. Compared to the sibling
payment-flow test experiment, this one additionally exercises on-the-fly
audio synthesis (parselmouth), asset generation and storage, parallel
async worker processes, and a headphone prescreen.

The recruiter is selected via the config file rather than in this experiment file:

- ``config.txt`` (default) sets ``recruiter = devprolific``, which simulates the Prolific API
    locally (requests are logged instead of sent, and no credentials or payments are involved), so
    running this directory directly cannot accidentally start paid recruitment.
- ``config.txt.prolific`` sets ``recruiter = prolific`` and is swapped in explicitly for paid test
    deployments with real participants.

The Lucid variant still lives in ``experiment.py.lucid`` (with ``config.txt.lucid``) because its
timeline and Experiment class genuinely differ (LucidConsent, a welcome page, and a ``recruit()``
override).
