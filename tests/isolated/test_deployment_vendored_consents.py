"""Guard against drift between the vendored consents_cococo copies.

The deployment-test experiments each carry their own byte-identical copy of
the shared consents_cococo package (from
https://gitlab.com/computational-audition-lab/cococo-shared), because a
deployment packages only the experiment directory. This test fails loudly if
someone updates one copy but not the other.
