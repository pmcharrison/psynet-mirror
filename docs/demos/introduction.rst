Introduction
============

The best way to start exploring PsyNet is by playing with some demos.
This gives you a quick feel for how to implement various experiment features
in PsyNet. When it comes to implementing your own experiment, you can then take
one of the PsyNet demos as a starting point and modify it to your own ends.

The `PsyNet repository <https://gitlab.com/PsyNetDev/PsyNet>`_ contains a large number
of demos in its `demos directory <https://gitlab.com/PsyNetDev/PsyNet/-/tree/master/demos>`_.
These demos are not particularly polished (yet), but they cover a range of PsyNet features,
and they are used by PsyNet's automated tests to make sure that new releases don't break
pre-existing features.

This section of the documentation highlights a few demos that we think are particularly
useful for understanding PsyNet. You are encouraged to look through the source code of these demos
and relate it to what you read here. If you're particularly interested in certain functionality,
you can download the demo and run it yourself. If you want to use a demo as a basis for your
own experiment, the best thing is to copy that demo into a separate directory (outside the PsyNet
repository) and make your changes there.
