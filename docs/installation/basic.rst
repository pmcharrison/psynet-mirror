Basic installation
==================

If you just want to use `psynet` in an experiment and you don't
need to run the demos or edit the source code, you can simply install it with `pip3`:

.. code-block:: console

    pip3 install git+ssh://git@gitlab.com/computational-audition-lab/psynet

.. note::
   You must have set up your GitLab SSH keys already.
