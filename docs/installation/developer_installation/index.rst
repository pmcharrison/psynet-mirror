Developer installation
======================

If you want to work on PsyNet as a developer, you might find it easier to bypass
Docker and instead install PsyNet and its dependencies within a local virtual environment.
This is more time-consuming and error-prone, but ultimately it can help you to
develop and debug PsyNet code a bit faster.
