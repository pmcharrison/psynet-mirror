.. _experiment_directory:

Experiment directory
====================

A PsyNet experiment implementation is defined by a particular *experiment directory*.
This directory contains all the files you need to run your experiment.
When you deploy an experiment, a slimmed down version of this directory is created and uploaded
to a web server.

When you are developing a PsyNet experiment it is good practice to use a *version control system*
for keeping track of changes to your experiment directory.
In particular, we advise that you use *Git* because PsyNet itself uses some Git features
as part of its deployment process. To learn more visit
`Version control with Git <../tutorials/version_control_with_git.html>`_.

Your experiment directory contains various important files and directories.
Let's talk through what these different files and directories do.
While reading this document, have a look at the experiment directory from a real
PsyNet experiment, the `Carillon Experiment <https://github.com/pmcharrison/2022-consonance-carillon>`_.

-   ``.python-version`` records the Python major and minor version used when the
    experiment was scaffolded. PsyNet generates it from the active interpreter.

-   ``docker`` contains various scripts for a deprecated Docker API. We are considering this in a future version of PsyNet.

-   ``static`` can be used as a storage place for files that the front-end browser can access directly via HTTP.
    If you wanted to bypass PsyNet's asset management system, you could put individual scripts or media files in here,
    and then access them via ``https://your-experiment-url/static/your-file.png``.
    If you are storing large files you may want instead to use PsyNet's asset management system,
    see `Assets <../tutorials/assets.html>`_ for more details.

-   ``templates`` is used for customising PsyNet’s front-end. It contains
    `Jinja2 templates <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/>`_; Jinja2 is a popular templating library for Python.
    Most experiments do not need to use this folder, but for an example of how to use it, see
    `Writing custom frontends <../tutorials/writing_custom_frontends.html>`_.

-   ``.gitignore`` controls which files Git tracks. It takes a standard format that comes from Git;
    you can learn more by Googling ``gitignore``. If a file is included within ``.gitignore``, it will not
    be included in your Git repository and hence won't be visible on (for example) GitHub.
    Importantly, files included in ``gitignore`` are **also** excluded from experiment deployments.
    This means for example that if you specify media files in ``gitignore`` then they won't be uploaded
    to the remote server's experiment directory.
    By default, there are some files/folders that are always excluded from this upload process,
    and this list is hard-coded into Dallinger. Currently it looks like this:

        - ``.git``
        - ``config.txt``
        - ``*.db``
        - ``*.dmg``
        - ``node_modules``
        - ``snapshots``
        - ``data``
        - ``develop``
        - ``server.log``
        - ``__pycache__``

-   ``Dockerfile`` is used by Docker to define the experiment's Docker image. Normally you should not edit this file
    directly, but instead use the boilerplate file provided by PsyNet. You can update this file to
    their latest PsyNet versions by running ``psynet scripts update`` within an experiment directory.
    If the file is missing entirely, you can recreate it with ``psynet scripts scaffold``.

-   ``.cursor/skills/psynet/`` contains PsyNet-managed Agent Skills for experiment
    implementation, validation, deployment, data, and participant evidence.
    ``psynet scripts update`` replaces this managed subdirectory with the version
    shipped by the installed PsyNet release. The directory is gitignored (and
    dockerignored) so it is not committed or uploaded with the experiment;
    other directories under ``.cursor/skills/`` are experiment-owned, preserved
    on update, and remain eligible to track.

-   ``Dockertag`` determines the name of the Docker image that is built for the present experiment.
    It defaults to the name of the current directory.

-   ``README.md`` is a README file. You should put information about your experiment here for future readers.
    ``psynet scripts scaffold`` and ``psynet scripts update`` create a default README when missing, but never
    overwrite an existing one.

-   ``__init__.py`` is created automatically when you deploy the experiment; it tells Python to treat the directory as a
    package. You don’t need to worry about this file in practice.

-   ``carillon_samples.csv`` is specific to the Carillon Experiment implementation, we don't need to worry about it now.

-   ``config.txt`` is required in every experiment directory (it may be empty).
    It defines configuration parameters for local runs and online deployment.
    New experiments can get a demo template via ``psynet scripts scaffold`` /
    ``psynet setup``. An existing file (including an empty one) is preserved on
    scaffold and update. If you are upgrading an older experiment that never had
    a ``config.txt`` and you keep settings in ``Experiment.config``, create a
    blank file with ``touch config.txt`` rather than scaffolding a full
    template; see :ref:`configuration`.

-   ``constraints.txt`` stores the locked versions of Python packages used when
    you install or deploy a **standalone** experiment. It is generated
    automatically (do not edit it by hand). Create or refresh it with
    ``psynet setup`` or ``psynet generate-constraints`` (Dallinger's lock
    policy via ``uv run``). Bundled demos omit it because they use the PsyNet
    repository's development environment. For Docker mode, ``psynet setup
    --docker`` still writes a local ``constraints.txt`` so the experiment
    directory is complete.

-   ``experiment.py`` is a Python file that defines the primary experiment logic.
    Split substantial helpers into sibling modules and import them with
    relative imports (see :ref:`experiment_python_modules`).

-   ``instructions.py`` is specific to the Carillon Experiment implementation, we don't need to worry about it now.

-   ``prepare_docker_image.sh`` is an optional file that provides extra setup code that is run when preparing
    the experiment's Docker image. Here we use it to install a particular dependency for stimulus generation.

-   ``pytest.ini`` is a boilerplate PsyNet file, you should not have to edit it yourself.
    If it goes missing, you can recreate it with ``psynet scripts scaffold``.

-   ``questionnaire.py`` is specific to the Carillon Experiment implementation, we don't need to worry about it now.

-   ``requirements.txt`` is where you specify the packages that your experiment will depend on.
    This file should always contain a link to the PsyNet library, for example:

    ::

        psynet@git+https://gitlab.com/psynetdev/psynet@d54c3f7a0afddebe1e53676c47c9a31f9cb9a827#egg=psynet

    This particular example indicates that the experiment should use a particular version of PsyNet from
    GitHub. The version is specified here by the long string that comes after the ``@`` symbol:
    ``d54c3f7a0afddebe1e53676c47c9a31f9cb9a827``.
    This string corresponds to a particular commit hash.
    You can also specify a particular version number here, for example ``10.3.0``.

-   ``server.log`` is an automatically generated log file, don’t worry about it.

-   ``synth.py`` is specific to the Carillon Experiment implementation, we don't need to worry about it now.

-   ``test.py`` is a boilerplate PsyNet file that defines generic tests for the experiment.
    You can run these tests in Docker by running ``docker/run pytest test.py``.
    If you want to customize these tests you should normally override specific methods in the Experiment class,
    for example ``Experiment.test_experiment`` and ``Experiment.test_check_bots``.
    If this file is missing, you can regenerate it with ``psynet scripts scaffold``.

    ``volume_calibration.py`` is specific to the Carillon Experiment implementation, we don't need to worry about it now.


.. _experiment_python_modules:

Importing other Python files
----------------------------

You can split experiment code across several ``.py`` files in the experiment
directory. Dallinger imports that directory as a package, so modules sitting
beside ``experiment.py`` are submodules of that package. From
``experiment.py`` (and from other files in the same package) import them
relatively:

.. code-block:: python

    from . import instructions
    from .synth import synthesize_stimulus

A plain ``import instructions`` often works when you run pytest from the
experiment directory, but it fails in the web, worker, and clock processes
with ``ModuleNotFoundError``. Putting the experiment directory on
``sys.path`` is not a safe workaround: a file named ``json.py`` or
``tests.py`` would shadow the standard library.

Standalone scripts that you invoke as ordinary Python, such as
``python -m audit.power.core``, are not loaded as that package. Those files keep
using ordinary top-level imports of the same helpers.
