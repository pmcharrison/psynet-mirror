Theming
=======

Every participant-facing page (ad, consent, timeline, waiting and error pages)
shares a default theme. The theme aims to be quiet: participants should notice
the task, not the interface. Colour is reserved for the primary action, the
progress indicator and selected options, so that the surrounding interface does
not compete with your stimuli.

The default layout places page content on a white surface over a lightly tinted
page background. This gives the content a visible boundary, which makes it
obvious where a page ends and whether it needs scrolling. Below 720px wide the
surface padding tightens so the same pages fit a phone without horizontal
overflow.

Design tokens
-------------

The theme is defined in a single stylesheet, ``psynet/resources/css/participant.css``,
which is served at ``/static/css/participant.css``. Everything it draws is
expressed through CSS custom properties, so in most cases you can restyle an
experiment by redefining a handful of tokens rather than overriding rules.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 20 50

   * - Token
     - Default
     - Purpose
   * - ``--psynet-page-bg``
     - ``#eef1f6``
     - Page background behind the content surface.
   * - ``--psynet-surface``
     - ``#ffffff``
     - Content surface that holds page content.
   * - ``--psynet-surface-sunken``
     - ``#f7f9fc``
     - Panels that group response options.
   * - ``--psynet-chrome-bg``
     - ``#d8e3f4``
     - The page's chrome: the progress rail above the content and the footer
       below it, which are tinted rather than sharing the content surface.
       Deliberately deeper than ``--psynet-page-bg``, so that an empty
       progress rail is legible and the footer does not dissolve into the page
       it abuts, and because the footer's controls are filled with
       ``--psynet-surface`` and need to read against the bar behind them. It
       cannot go much deeper: the footer's control borders are
       contrast-checked against this value.
   * - ``--psynet-footer-bg``
     - ``var(--psynet-chrome-bg)``
     - The footer specifically, so it can be retinted without the rail.
   * - ``--psynet-rail-fill``
     - ``var(--psynet-accent)``
     - Filled portion of the timeline progress rail and the media-download
       rail. Follows the accent in light mode; dark mode dims it, because a
       fully saturated accent on the dark rail dominated the page.
   * - ``--psynet-accent-solid``
     - ``var(--psynet-accent)``
     - Fill for solid buttons, with ``--psynet-accent-solid-contrast`` for
       their labels. Split from the accent because dark mode needs the accent
       light enough to read as link text, while a whole button painted that
       colour glares.
   * - ``--psynet-border``
     - ``#dfe5ee``
     - Default border colour, and the progress-bar track (and its
       percentage pill).
   * - ``--psynet-text``
     - ``#1f2733``
     - Body text.
   * - ``--psynet-text-muted``
     - ``#5c6b7f``
     - Secondary text, for example the reward footer.
   * - ``--psynet-accent``
     - ``#3070c8``
     - Primary action, progress fill, selected states, focus ring.
   * - ``--psynet-accent-rgb``
     - ``48, 112, 200``
     - Comma-separated channels of the accent. Bootstrap links and
       utilities such as ``text-primary`` read this, not the hex token.
   * - ``--psynet-accent-hover``
     - ``#275ba4``
     - Hover state for primary actions and links.
   * - ``--psynet-accent-hover-rgb``
     - ``39, 91, 164``
     - Comma-separated channels of the hover colour, for Bootstrap.
   * - ``--psynet-accent-contrast``
     - ``#ffffff``
     - Text drawn on the accent, for example primary-button labels.
   * - ``--psynet-danger``
     - ``#c0454c``
     - Recording, warnings, "too loud" audio-meter states, and the footer's
       ``Exit`` control. Named colour ``red`` resolves here.
   * - ``--psynet-danger-soft``
     - ``#fbeff0``
     - Quiet danger surface, for example hovering ``Exit``.
   * - ``--psynet-success``
     - ``#2f7d5b``
     - Completed stages and "just right" audio-meter states. Named
       colour ``green`` resolves here.
   * - ``--psynet-warning``
     - ``#9a6700``
     - Get-ready stages. Named colour ``orange`` resolves here.
   * - ``--psynet-content-width``
     - ``900px``
     - Maximum width of the content surface.
   * - ``--psynet-measure``
     - ``62ch``
     - Maximum width of prose, so long text stays readable.
   * - ``--psynet-graphic-vertical-chrome``
     - ``25rem``
     - Height reserved around a ``GraphicPrompt`` so the page still
       fits a typical laptop window. Shrinks the graphic when 60% of
       the window would make the page scroll. Short windows (below
       540px tall) use ``10rem`` instead.
   * - ``--psynet-graphic-min-size``
     - ``8rem``
     - Floor for that chrome cap, so a landscape phone cannot collapse
       the graphic to zero.
   * - ``--psynet-footer-clearance``
     - ``5rem``
     - Fallback space reserved at the bottom of pages that render
       ``#footer``, used until the footer has been measured. Pages without a
       footer (the ad, the consent gateway, ``show_footer=False``) do not get
       this padding.
   * - ``--psynet-audio-meter-height``
     - ``10px``
     - Height of the microphone-level track.

To recolour an experiment, redefine the tokens in your own stylesheet.
Buttons, progress, and focus follow ``--psynet-accent``. Links and Bootstrap
utilities such as ``text-primary`` also need the matching ``-rgb`` tokens,
because Bootstrap composes those colours from RGB triples:

::

    /* static/theme.css */
    :root {
        --psynet-accent: #7a4fa3;
        --psynet-accent-rgb: 122, 79, 163;
        --psynet-accent-hover: #623e84;
        --psynet-accent-hover-rgb: 98, 62, 132;
        --psynet-page-bg: #f5f2f8;
    }

and register it on your experiment class:

::

    class Exp(psynet.experiment.Experiment):
        css_links = ["static/theme.css"]

Because ``participant.css`` avoids ``!important``, an ordinary rule in your own
stylesheet is enough to override a default; you should not need to escalate
specificity. See the ``custom_theme`` demo for a complete example.

.. note::

    Token overrides apply to timeline pages. ``css`` and ``css_links`` are not
    currently injected into the ad and consent pages; to restyle those, provide
    your own ``templates/ad.html`` or ``templates/consent.html``.

Wider stimuli
-------------

If a stimulus needs more room than the default content width, widen the surface
for the whole experiment:

::

    Exp.css.append(":root { --psynet-content-width: 1140px; }")

Prose remains bounded by ``--psynet-measure``, so widening the surface does not
produce over-long lines of text.

Colour and stimuli
------------------

For experiments where colour is part of the measurement, consider neutralising
the accent so that no saturated colour appears near your stimuli:

::

    Exp.css.append(":root { --psynet-accent: #44556b; --psynet-accent-rgb: 68, 85, 107; }")

Named colours on trial progress stages (``red``, ``green``, ``blue``)
follow ``--psynet-danger``, ``--psynet-success``, and ``--psynet-accent``
rather than the browser's primary colours; override those tokens the same
way, or pass a hex value to :class:`~psynet.timeline.ProgressStage`.
``white`` is left as CSS white so a caption stays visible in dark mode.

Dark mode
---------

Setting ``color_mode`` to ``dark`` or ``auto`` in ``config.txt`` switches the
tokens to a dark palette; see :doc:`/experiment_development/configuration`. If
you override tokens yourself and support dark mode, define your overrides for
both schemes:

::

    :root {
        --psynet-accent: #7a4fa3;
        --psynet-accent-rgb: 122, 79, 163;
    }
    [data-bs-theme="dark"] {
        --psynet-accent: #b48ad4;
        --psynet-accent-rgb: 180, 138, 212;
    }

Response options
----------------

:class:`~psynet.modular_page.RadioButtonControl` and
:class:`~psynet.modular_page.CheckboxControl` render each option as a full-width
row with a minimum height of 46px, so the whole row is clickable. The rows sit
in a panel (``.psynet-options``) that grows with them, so a long list scrolls
the page rather than a nested scrollbar inside the control. Mark that page with
``expect_scrolling=True``. The markup is:

::

    <div class="control-container psynet-options">
        <label class="psynet-option">
            <input type="radio" id="..." name="..." class="response">
            <span class="psynet-option-label">Label</span>
        </label>
    </div>

If you previously styled these controls by targeting the bare ``label`` or
``input`` elements, target ``.psynet-option`` and ``.psynet-option-label``
instead.

:class:`~psynet.modular_page.PushButtonControl` groups choices in
``.push-button-container``. Vertical lists (``arrange_vertically=True``)
stay in a single column. Buttons are already distinct objects, so they sit
directly on the content surface with no panel behind them; the list grows
with them in the same way as ``.psynet-options``.

Next and Reset sit in ``.psynet-actions``. If you previously selected
those buttons as a direct child of ``#trial-stage``, target
``.psynet-actions`` instead.

The selected state is styled with ``:has()``, which is why the default
``min_browser_version`` is Chrome 105; see
:doc:`/experiment_development/configuration`.

Pages that scroll
-----------------

The footer is normally fixed to the bottom of the window, and pages that
render it reserve room for it on ``body`` so that content is never left
permanently underneath. How much room cannot be written as a fixed value: the
footer wraps onto more rows on a narrow phone, with a longer translated label,
or at a larger font size. PsyNet therefore measures the rendered footer and
publishes ``--psynet-footer-height``, falling back to
``--psynet-footer-clearance`` until the measurement runs. Pages without a
footer get no padding.

On a narrow screen (480px or less) whose page already scrolls, PsyNet hands the
footer back to the document instead: it adds ``psynet-footer-in-flow`` to
``body``, which unpins the footer so that it sits at the end of the content.
Pinning it there would spend a fifth of a phone screen on chrome the
participant scrolls past anyway. The decision is remeasured when the content or
the window changes, and it ignores the footer's own height so that unpinning
cannot flip it back.

A page that does not declare ``expect_scrolling`` should fit a typical
laptop window (1280×720) without scrolling. Verify that with the front-end
layout check in :doc:`tests`; bots do not render a layout.

If a page is genuinely meant to be longer than the window, say so:

::

    InfoPage(long_briefing_text, time_estimate=60, expect_scrolling=True)

or, for a custom page class:

::

    class MyLongPage(Page):
        expect_scrolling = True

Passing ``expect_scrolling=False`` to the constructor overrides a class-level
``True``, which is useful when a normally long page is instantiated in a short
variant. The bundled consent pages already declare it. The attribute only
affects testing; it does not change what participants see.
