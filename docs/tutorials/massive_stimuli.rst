Massive Stimuli
====================

It is a quite common task to have a large number of stimuli (e.g., video, images, or here audio) you want to present to participants and receive responses for (e.g., ratings or validation).
In this tutorial, we will show you how to handle this task in PsyNet using AWS S3.

Getting started
---------------

1. The first step is to install the `AWS client <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html>`_
2. Now check it's installed properly by running ``aws --version`` in your terminal.
3. Now open another terminal window and move to the audio directory you want to upload, e.g. ``cd ~/my-audio-files/``



.. warning::
    Make sure your filenames don't contain spaces or special characters which can break the URL. The best practice is to only use lower case latin characters (``a-z``), underscores (``_``) and hyphens (``-``).

4. Now upload the files to a S3 bucket and key (subdirectory) of your choice, e.g. ``aws s3 cp . s3://my-bucket/my-key/`` which will upload all files in the current directory to the bucket ``my-bucket`` and key ``my-key``.
5. This will take a while if you have a lot of files. Once this is done, you can list the files by running ``aws s3 ls s3://my-bucket/my-key/`` in your terminal.
6. Now create a bucket policy to allow public access to the files. You can do this by running ``aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket my-bucket --policy file://my-policy.json`` in your terminal. The policy file should look like this:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": "*",
                "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/my-key/*"
            }
        ]
    }

7. Now you can access the files by their URL, e.g. ``https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/my-key/my-file.wav``
8. You can now make a text file which contains the filenames of the files, by running ``ls > stimuli.txt`` in your terminal.

.. note::
    It can be useful to filter by the file extension, e.g. ``ls *.wav > stimuli.txt``

9. Now you can create nodes from the text file, e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

    from psynet.trial.static import StaticNode, StaticTrial
    from psynet.modular_page import AudioPrompt, PushButtonControl, ModularPage

    S3_BUCKET = "my-bucket"
    S3_KEY = "my-key"

    def get_s3_url(stimulus):
        return f"https://{S3_BUCKET}.s3.amazonaws.com/{S3_KEY}/{stimulus}"

    with open("stimuli.txt", "r") as f:
        stimuli = f.read().splitlines()

    nodes = [
        StaticNode(
            definition={"url": get_s3_url(stimulus)},
        )
        for stimulus in stimuli
    ]

    class AudioRatingTrial(StaticTrial):
        time_estimate = 5

        def show_trial(self, experiment, participant):
            return ModularPage(
                "audio_rating",
                AudioPrompt(
                    self.node.definition["url"],
                    "How much do you like this song?",
                ),
                PushButtonControl(
                    ["Not at all", "A little", "Very much"],
                ),
            )
