Overview
========

PsyNet is a new platform for running advanced behavioral experiments
ranging from adaptive psychophysics to simulated cultural evolution.
It builds on the virtual lab framework `Dallinger <https://dallinger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
Its goal is to enable researchers to implement and deploy experiments as efficiently as possible,
while placing minimal constraints on the complexity of the experiment design.

This website contains a variety of resources to help you learn more about PsyNet.
Some particularly useful resources are highlighted below,
but see the sidebar for a full list.

- :ref:`When to use PsyNet? <applications>`: Learn about the use cases for which PsyNet is optimized.

- :ref:`Demos <demos_introduction>`: See demos of different PsyNet features.

- :ref:`Example experiments <example_experiments>`: See code repositories for real-world PsyNet experiments.

- `GitLab repository <https://gitlab.com/PsyNetDev/PsyNet>`_: Explore PsyNet's source code.
