If you haven't installed the `psynet already`, follow the instructions in :doc:`installation`.

Then, navigate to the timeline demo directory, for example:

::

    cd ~/my-projects/psynet/demos/timeline

Make sure you're in the appropriate virtual environment, for example:

::

    workon dlgr_env

Finally, run the following command:

::

    dallinger debug --verbose

The demo illustrates the timeline functionality.
You can also see the network visualisation by entering the
