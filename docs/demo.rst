If you haven't installed the `dlgr_utils already`, follow the instructions in :doc:`installation`.

Then, navigate to the installation directory, for example:

::

    cd ~/my-projects/dlgr_utils

Make sure you're in the appropriate virtual environment, for example:

::

    workon dlgr_env

Finally, run the following command:

::

    dallinger debug --verbose

The demo should illustrate features such as the timeline functionality and the network visualisation.
