About
=====

`psynet` is an extension of the `Dallinger platform <http://docs.dallinger.io/en/latest/>`_,
a powerful framework for automating online data collection through crowdsourcing 
platforms such as `Amazon Mechanical Turk <https://www.mturk.com/>`_.
The `psynet` framework provides an additional level of abstraction above Dallinger,
helping users to focus on the control flow of the experiment rather than the details
of its implementation. Many of its features were inspired by 
`psychTestR <https://pmcharrison.github.io/psychTestR/>`_, an experiment design
framework for the R programming language, and some of the tutorial content is 
shared between these two frameworks.

Development
-----------

`psynet` was developed at the 
`Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics <https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en>`_
by Peter Harrison, with help and feedback from other members of Nori Jacoby's 
`Computational Auditory Perception research group 
<https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/research-group-computational-auditory-perception.html>`_.
The software is still in the early stages of development
and should be considered an 'alpha' project, with the API potentially subject to breaking changes.

Repository
----------

The source code is hosted at https://gitlab.com/computational-audition-lab/dlgr-utils.
