Recruiter-Specific Deployment Steps
===================================

Prolific 🔹 
-----------

Setting up the experiment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Experiment costs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. To calculate the base payment for your experiment, set the
“\ **wage_per_hour**\ ” parameter in the config to 9 Pounds (Prolific
recommendation).

.. code:: python

   "wage_per_hour": 9

2. Run psynet estimate in the terminal and note your estimated
experiment duration and cost. You should include the cost and the
duration in your experiment’s title Also, say people need Chrome and
optionally headphones and microphones if needed.

3. In the get_prolific_settings() <#experiment-script>`__
function, specify the duration using the
"prolific_estimated_completion_minutes" parameter and the cost using the
"base_payment" parameter.

 

- For example, when you run psynet estimate, you will get a result like
  this one:

❯❯ Estimated maximum reward for participant: EUR4.95.

❯❯ Estimated time to complete experiment: 33 min.

- In this case, the prolific parameters must be as follows:

.. code:: python

   "base_payment": 4.95
   "prolific_estimated_completion_minutes": 33

4. After calculating the base payment, you **MUST** set the
**“wage_per_hour”** parameter to 0 for the actual Prolific deployment.
Otherwise, it would cause problems in the payment.

.. code:: python

   "wage_per_hour": 0

5. Make sure all time_estimates are set appropriately such that
the overall duration of your experiment (you get it from psynet
estimate) matches your expectation.

6. Check that the experiment costs are right:

-  Use your own data (and possibly but not mandatory the group
   data) to estimate how long it takes for each trial, pre-screeners,
   and the entire experiment

-  Start running (if possible) a small number of participants
   (e.g., 10) and try to see if your time estimate is wrong by more than
   30% - redeploy.

-  If you had run the experiment, update the run time based on
   real data.




Example of adapting the consent form to say 9 pounds per hour
while wage_per_hour in config is set to 0:
\*
customconsent.py <https://gitlab.com/computational-audition-lab/octa_projects-elinevg/octa_gibbs1/-/blob/main/customconsent.py?ref_type=heads>`__`

\*
templates/custom_main_consent.html <https://gitlab.com/computational-audition-lab/octa_projects-elinevg/octa_gibbs1/-/blob/main/templates/custom_main_consent.html?ref_type=heads>`__`

Payment strategy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Nori- write this down.

-  Experiments with minimal pre-screening (e.g static experiments)

-  Experiments that needs some pre-screening (e.g GSP and chain
   experiments) 25% Traffic -> this is a classical use case to
   explicitly test; if you get 10 people, ~7-8 people should pass

-  Experiments with “technical” pre-screening.

-  Experiments with high percentage of filtered people (more 25% and
   particularly more than 50%). → separate experiment for prescreener
   and then whitelist participants who succeed prescreen experiment

Experiment script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case of assets, make sure you are not using DebugStorage, but
S3Storage or a LocalStorage.

Add config params under class Exp(psynet.experiment.Experiment):

.. code:: python

   config = {
       **get_prolific_settings(),
       "initial_recruitment_size": 5,
       "title": "Put your experiment title here (Chrome browser, ~XX mins)",
       "description": (
           "This is a speaking experiment that needs to be done in a quiet "
           "place WITHOUT headphones. You will be asked to imitate rhythms. "
           "The task will take about 15 minutes."
       ),
       "contact_email_on_error": "computational.audition@gmail.com",
       "organization_name": "Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics",
       "show_reward": False,
   }

An example for title:

“Check recorded texts (Chrome browser, Headphone required, Native
english speakers only; ~10-15 mins)”

Example for description:

“In this experiment you will hear spoken sentences and need to judge the
quality of their transcript. The experiment requires Chrome browser and
Headphones and is intended for Native English speakers. It lasts 10-12
min.”

You may also want to add other config parameters that are optional,
e.g.,

.. code:: python

   "force_incognito_mode": True

Note that we actually recommend force_incognito_mode=True for most
experiments as it makes sure participants actually use incognito. Not
having incognito can generate differences in display if participants are
using browser add-ons. If you don’t care about this display issue you
can set this to False.

This forces people to use an incognito browser, which helps against the
red screen error. For an overview of all options, see
https://psynetdev.gitlab.io/PsyNet/experiment_development/configuration.html

Then, you will need to add the function get_prolific_settings() to set
up config parameters specifically pertaining to Prolific. Add this
function at the top of your project (you can find
qualification_prolific.json in the CAP-safe):

.. code:: python

   def get_prolific_settings():
       with open("qualification_prolific_en.json", "r") as f:
           qualification = json.dumps(json.load(f))

       return {
           "recruiter": "prolific",
           "base_payment": <base payment in currency>,  # based on survey minutes
           "prolific_estimated_completion_minutes": <estimated completion time>,
           "prolific_recruitment_config": qualification,
           "auto_recruit": False,
           "currency": "£",
           "wage_per_hour": 0,  # use base payment only
       }

.. note::

   For the time being, until we change PsyNet, you need to use
   ``wage_per_hour = 0``. This overrides the bonus payment system.
   Currently, variable payment is not allowed in Prolific, so everything
   is paid as base payment.

-  **Make sure your payment is in line with the estimated completion
   time**; Prolific requires a *minimum of £6 per hour*, based on the
   median completion time across participants in your study. You can
   verify your experiment duration by `having multiple group members
   test out your experiment <general_deployment_process.html#testing-within-the-group>`__ before you
   deploy and checking their median completion time. Keep an eye on this
   while running the experiment with participants!

-  **Do NOT set a value for the ‘id’ parameter in the config**. We do
   not set it to a meaningful name through the config parameters because
   it is shown to participants on the first page of the experiment (in
   the left top corner after ‘Application ID’). If you do not set an
   ‘id’ parameter in config, PsyNet will generate a random hash string
   as ID. In Prolific this ID will show as the internal name of the
   experiment.

Prolific qualifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add the qualification_prolific_en.json file to your experiment folder
(You can find it in the cap-safe). This currently specifies
qualifications for collecting data from **English speaking participants
in the UK**. This file will also specify important parameters for
Prolific, such as country of recruitment, participant demographics, etc.

-  You can manually modify the exact demographic requirements in
   Prolific (after you deploy, before you publish). Their GUI will also
   tell you the number of active participants who fulfill these
   criteria.

Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** In **PsyNet 11.9.0** you should add
following settings to .dallingerconfig:

[Prolific]

prolific_workspace = <WORKSPACE_YOU_WANT_TO_USE>

prolific_project = <YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER>

-  Choose workspace that you want to deploy (check account balance)

.. image:: /_static/images/lab_deployments/image16.png
   :width: 8.5in

-  You should create a project folder for your experiments. Please use
      your own name. For example: ‘Elif Experiments’

.. image:: /_static/images/lab_deployments/image13.png
   :width: 8.5in

Deploy the experiment. Please see `deployment
process <deploying.html#actual-deployment>`__.

Prolific: check & adapt study details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before participants can take part in your experiment, you will have to
confirm some settings on Prolific first. For that go to
`prolific.com <https://www.prolific.com/>`__ and login to the group's
account. You can find the credential in the
`cap-safe <https://gitlab.com/computational-audition-lab/cap-safe>`__.

In the “Draft” tab of the “Projects” folder you will find your
experiment:

.. image:: /_static/images/lab_deployments/image14.png
   :width: 8.5in

Click on the ‘ACTION’ button and next on the ‘Move’ button to move the
experiment to your personal experiment folder.

Then click on the name of your experiment. This will lead you to a page
where you can check and adjust some of your experiment parameters. Make
sure that everything is set up the way you intended; especially the
payment parameters! Also check whether the formatting of the description
is as intended.

Here, you should set the internal name to “<your name> -
<keyword/phrase>” (e.g. “ofer - coin game”). This is not visible to
participants. This will help us identify who each study belongs to,
especially when sorting through messages from participants.

Additionally, on this page, you will need to set the approvement process
to “Approve and pay”, otherwise you have to approve all your
participants manually:|image4|

Prolific: estimate & claim experiment cost
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can get an estimate of the total cost of your experiment by setting
the recruitment size to the total number of participants you are looking
to recruit (plus a few more to be safe, if you have a prescreener) and
scrolling down to the “Study Cost” section and finding the total. This
includes the Prolific service fee. **Check whether there is enough
unclaimed money in the Prolific account (if not, contact Nori about
this). Once there is enough unclaimed money, post the estimate to the
#prolific_experiment_claims channel** on Slack, and **set your
recruitment size back to your initial recruitment size**.

.. image:: /_static/images/lab_deployments/image52.png
   :width: 8.5in

.. image:: /_static/images/lab_deployments/image58.png
   :width: 8.5in

Prolific: preview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want a final test of your experiment through Prolific, you can do
that if you change the participant_id in the url.

Please note that the data is saved in the database. Typically you want
to run the first trials, but not completing the experiment because your
data is saved as a real participant. In some experiments (like a static
experiment) you can then able to filter the data for participants that
did not finish the experiment.

Prolific: publish experiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you are happy with all the settings, click on “publish” to put your
experiment online.

Monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~

Recruitment strategy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is recommended to start with an initial recruitment size of 5-10
people. After all these initial participants have finished the
experiment, you should check that you do not get any errors and that
your initial time estimate for the experiment is accurate. Only then you
can increase the experiment size manually. To do so click on “Action” on
the upper right side of the prolific dashboard and then on “increase
places”.

.. image:: /_static/images/lab_deployments/image35.png
   :width: 8.5in

The number you set here is the number of the total number of
participants for your experiment. I.e., if you have already 5
participants and you want to get 5 additional participants, this number
has to be 10. Make sure that you do not have too many participants
taking your experiment at once, because this could overload the server
and cause errors and slow-downs.

At any time, you should check for errors (you get an error report on
each export) and make sure that the median wage per hour (indicated on
the prolific dashboard) does not go under the minimum of £6 per hour.

**Auto-recruit**

Auto-recruit is a functionality in psynet that automatically increases
places in your experiment. You can change this parameter from the
experiment dashboard:

.. _section-9:

|image5|

The logic is as follows: Whenever someone completes the study, another
spot will be automatically added. I.e., if you have currently 3 people
taking the experiment and turn it on, then there will always be 3 active
participants.

**You have to be really careful when using this.** In case you use it,
make sure to consider following points:

-  Only use it after you collected the first 10 participants, if you did
   not get any complaints from participants, and if you have checked
   whether the exported data looks ok

-  Stop Auto recruit when you get to 90% of the experiment. After which
   you manually recruit the rest. This is a good idea since in some
   experiments participants are still continuously recruited and have
   very little to do. This way they will be fully compensated but
   contribute very little. To avoid this problem toward the end of the
   experiment stopping auto recruit earlier is a good idea.

-  **Really make sure that auto-recruit is off, when stopping the
   experiment. Clicking on “stop” in the prolific dashboard is not
   enough.**

.. _section-10:

Messages in Prolific
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Messages that are specific to your experiment can be seen in the chat
box on the lower right.

It is suggested though, to click on “Messages” on the upper side of the
screen, to see all messages (also messages related to other
experiments).\ |image6|

The reason is that we want to keep our inbox clean and only in this view
can you archive messages. To do so (after you have handled the
participants issue) click on the checkbox of the message and then click
on “archive”.

.. image:: /_static/images/lab_deployments/image32.png
   :width: 8.5in

Answering messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since there can be various reasons why a participant is messaging you,
there is no standard way to answer. Most of the time though, a
participant is messaging you because they have encountered an error in
your experiment. If so, you can look for that participant in the
“participant” tab of your psynet dashboard by pasting their ID from
prolific to the “worker id” field. There you will find a “Link for
resuming session”, which you can send to the participant.

If that does not work or the participant cannot continue the experiment
because of some issue on our side, you should approve them manually. You
can do so by searching for their ID in the prolific dashboard and
clicking on the checkmark. By doing do they will be payed the base
payment you have set in the beginning.

   :width: 8.5in

Termination
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Make sure that there are no participants actively taking the
   experiment

-  Approve/reject people in awaiting review

-  The status of the experiment should be “\ **COMPLETED”**

-  Turn off auto-recruit! Otherwise it will keep recruiting
   participants, even if you stopped the experiment

-  Put experiment in your folder on Prolific.

CINT (Lucid) 🔹

.. _setting-up-the-experiment-1:

Setting up the experiment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _experiment-costs-1:

Experiment costs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1) Adjust the “\ **wage_per_hour**\ ” parameter in the config according
   to the minimum wage in the targeted country. A list of minimum wages
   per country can be found at this
   `link <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yl-eEsLTxFAVyZECZfRQnDlYM8ykY9xlJpnsTpi5oKQ/edit#gid=0>`__.

.. code:: python

   "wage_per_hour": 6.5

2) Make sure all time_estimates are set appropriately such that the
   overall duration of your experiment (you get from psynet estimate)
   matches your expectation.

3) Run psynet estimate in the terminal and note your estimated
   experiment duration and cost. **DO NOT indicate the cost in your
   experiment’s title, only the duration. Also, say people need Chrome
   and optionally headphones and microphones if needed**.

4) Check that the experiment costs are right:

-  Use your own data (and possibly but not mandatory the group data) to
   estimate how long it takes for each trial, pre-screeners, and the
   entire experiment

-  Start running (if possible) a small number of participants (e.g., 10)
   and try to see if your time estimate is wrong by more than 30% -
   redeploy.

-  If you had run the experiment, update the run time based on real
   data.

.. _experiment-script-1:

Experiment script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the case of assets, make sure you are not using DebugStorage, but
S3Storage or a LocalStorage.

.. code:: python

   class Exp(psynet.experiment.Experiment):
       config = {
           **recruiter_settings,
           "initial_recruitment_size": 10,  # set to required numbers
           "language": LOCALE,  # set to the ISO-2 language code (e.g. 'tr' or 'en')
           "auto_recruit": False,
           "wage_per_hour": 6.5,  # set to minimum wage of target country
           "title": "Put your experiment title here (Chrome browser, ~XX mins)",
           "contact_email_on_error": "computational.audition+online_running@gmail.com",
           "organization_name": "Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics",
       }

CINT Recruiter Settings 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You will need to define recruiter_settings and add the function
get_lucid_settings() to set up config parameters specifically on CINT.
Add this function at the top of your project.

Set the following parameters:

-  lucid_recruitment_config_path: path to qualifications JSON
   file. (see `CINT Qualifications <#cint-qualifications>`__ for
   details)

-  termination_time_in_s: adjust the maximal time a participant
   can spend on the experiment

-  debug_recruiter: Only set it to ‘True’ during local testing

-  initial_response_within_s: Termination of the participant if
   the first response is not reached within that time.

-  bid_incidence: You can adjust the incidence rate here
   according to your experiment’s reports on lucid. Set it to a
   realistic value, but as high as possible.

-  inactivity_timeout_in_s: The inactivity (i.e., no clicking,
   no typing, no scrolling or moving the mouse) timeout in seconds.
   Adjust it according to your experiment design.

-  no_focus_timeout_in_s: Termination of the participant in case
   of moving the mouse outside the window or opening another tab. **This
   is active on all pages! Set it to a realistic value.**

-  aggressive_no_focus_timeout_in_s: The same setting as
   \`no_focus_timeout_in_s\`, but only used on the qualification
   verification pages. **It is important to verify the qualifications on
   the very first page to kick out sloppy participants.**

.. code:: python

   recruiter_settings = get_lucid_settings(
       lucid_recruitment_config_path=LUCID_CONFIG_PATH,
       termination_time_in_s=120 * 60,
       debug_recruiter=False,
       initial_response_within_s=180,
       bid_incidence=66,
       inactivity_timeout_in_s=120,
       no_focus_timeout_in_s=60,
       aggressive_no_focus_timeout_in_s=3,
   )

CINT Consent
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need to use CINT (Lucid) consent while deploying to CINT.

1) Import it from psynet.consent

.. code:: python

   from psynet.consent import LucidConsent

2) Define the consent parameter in your experiment.py

.. code:: python

   consent = LucidConsent

3) Make sure to add consent() function to your timeline. (Please
   note that additional audiovisual consent may be needed depending on
   your experiment.)

CINT Qualifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Setting Qualifications Automatically
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CINT has a standard qualification library and you can create custom
qualifications.

Currently, we have the following custom qualifications:

-  [\`\ `TIMEOUT <https://www.samplicio.us/fulcrum/QuestionDetails.aspx?QuestionSID=187e22aa-8a67-45c9-8a7c-481eeeaddfb0>`__\ \`]:
   warning participants they can't leave the page as they might be
   kicked out otherwise (set automatically)

-  [\`\ `MONOLINGUALISM <https://www.samplicio.us/fulcrum/QuestionDetails.aspx?QuestionSID=08a162fe-4c14-48c7-b850-1d09f95527a1>`__\ \`]:
   asking participants if they are monolingual

-  [\`\ `HAS_AUDIO <https://www.samplicio.us/fulcrum/QuestionDetails.aspx?QuestionSID=25434891-030a-405a-9616-e43961d674fa>`__\ \`]:
   asking participants if they can play audio

-  [\`\ `ALLOW_VOICE_RECORDING <https://www.samplicio.us/fulcrum/QuestionDetails.aspx?QuestionSID=9242d802-f6d6-4786-8049-50490dcd5179>`__\ \`]:
   asking participants if they can record their voice

-  [\`\ `BORN_IN_COUNTRY <https://www.samplicio.us/fulcrum/QuestionDetails.aspx?QuestionSID=2a6d41c7-c38c-4a69-ad12-2cca5074d98f>`__\ \`]:
   asking participants if they were born in the country

-  [\`\ `HAS_NATIONALITY <https://www.samplicio.us/fulcrum/QuestionDetails.aspx?QuestionSID=f91c6b4f-7167-4e30-95ab-9efb408f0537>`__\ \`]:
   asking participants

-  [\`\ `IS_NATIVE <https://www.samplicio.us/fulcrum/QuestionDetails.aspx?QuestionSID=c0833d98-be26-46df-8e01-1abbb740cda6>`__\ \`]:
   asking participants if they are native speakers

There are a variety of languages and countries available on CINT with
specific tags. You can get a list of all the available language (3
capital letters) and country (2 capital letters) tags by running the
following code in your terminal:

.. code:: bash

   psynet lucid locale

After getting the desired locales, you can generate qualifications
specific to each country by using a custom create_qualifications.py.
Please find an example code below that you can adjust and add to your
create_qualifications.py.

.. code:: python

   from tqdm import tqdm
   from psynet.lucid.qualifications import create_lucid_recruitment_config

   country_language_tags = (("DUT", "NL"),)

   for language_tag, country_tag in tqdm(country_language_tags):
       config_path = f"qualifications/lucid/lucid-{language_tag}-{country_tag}.json"
       create_lucid_recruitment_config(
           language_tag=language_tag,
           country_tag=country_tag,
           question_answer_dict={
               "MONOLINGUALISM": ["I was raised with my native language only"],
               "HAS_AUDIO": ["Yes"],
               "ALLOW_VOICE_RECORDING": ["Yes"],
               "BORN_IN_COUNTRY": ["Yes"],
               "HAS_NATIONALITY": ["Yes"],
               "IS_NATIVE": ["Yes"],
           },
           config_path=config_path,
           debug=True,
       )

Extending the qualification to new languages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can expand an existing qualification for a new language. Go to the
qualification page and add the question and the options. Make sure that
the options are in the same order as in the original. It is recommended
to use the English language as a reference so that the options match up.

.. _section-11:

Adding a new qualification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to the [`qualification overview
page <https://www.samplicio.us/fulcrum/Questions.aspx>`__] and click the
button "Add Qualification". Now set the Qualification Name. It is
recommended to use only capital letters and underscores
(e.g.`HAS_AUDIO\`). For the Qualification Type, select "Conditional List
– Single Punch". Set Minimum Displayed Conditions and Maximum Displayed
Conditions to 2. Now click "Save". Move down to "Step 2: Questions".
Click "Add Question Text". Select the language country pair you want to
add. Add the question text. Now add the options with line breaks in
"Mass Upload" and select the right language pair. Click "Save".

It takes some time for CINT to register new custom qualifications. If
you want to use it in your experiment, go to your qualification page,
right-click in Chrome on the page, and select "View Page Source". Now
search for "QuestionID", this field is the ID of the qualification. You
can now use this ID in your experiment:

.. code:: python

   from psynet.experiment import get_and_load_config
   from psynet.lucid import get_lucid_service
   from psynet.lucid.qualifications import create_lucid_recruitment_config

   language_tag = "DUT"
   country_tag = "NL"
   config_path = f"qualifications/lucid/lucid-{language_tag}-{country_tag}.json"

   config = get_and_load_config()
   service = get_lucid_service(config=config)
   custom_qualifications_dict = {
       **service.get_qualifications_dict(),
       "MY_NEW_QUALIFICATION": 200093,  # replace 200093 with actual ID
   }

   create_lucid_recruitment_config(
       language_tag=language_tag,
       country_tag=country_tag,
       question_answer_dict={
           "MONOLINGUALISM": ["I was raised with my native language only"],
           "HAS_AUDIO": ["Yes"],
           "ALLOW_VOICE_RECORDING": ["Yes"],
           "BORN_IN_COUNTRY": ["Yes"],
           "HAS_NATIONALITY": ["Yes"],
           "IS_NATIVE": ["Yes"],
       },
       config_path=config_path,
       debug=True,
       config=config,
       service=service,
       qualifications_dict=custom_qualifications_dict,
   )

Front-end confirmation of qualifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is recommended to let users confirm the qualifications in the
front-end. There are multiple reasons for this:

-  First, on the qualification pages, we have strict rules concerning
   how long they can leave the page. Since the majority of participants
   leave the experiment on the first page, this is a good way to
   terminate them here. Also, since this is fairly fast, it will reduce
   the termination LOI.

-  Second, it is good to double-check the requirements.

To do this, you can use the following code:

.. code:: python

   import psynet.experiment
   from psynet.consent import LucidConsent
   from psynet.timeline import Timeline
   from psynet.page import SuccessfulEndPage
   from psynet.lucid.qualifications import verify_lucid_qualifications

   LANGUAGE = "DUT"
   COUNTRY = "NL"
   LUCID_CONFIG_PATH = f"qualifications/lucid/lucid-{LANGUAGE}-{COUNTRY}.json"

   class Exp(psynet.experiment.Experiment):
       timeline = Timeline(
           verify_lucid_qualifications(LUCID_CONFIG_PATH),
           LucidConsent(),
           SuccessfulEndPage(),
       )

If you don't want to show all qualifications to the participants or want
to show them in a different order, you can specify them as an additional
argument:

.. code:: python

   verify_lucid_qualifications(
       LUCID_CONFIG_PATH,
       question_names=["TIMEOUT", "MONOLINGUALISM"],
   )

.. _section-12:

Summary Steps for Setting CINT Qualifications:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Access a list of available language and country tags using the
   command psynet lucid locale.

2) Use the provided Python script to create predefined qualifications
   (e.g.`HAS_AUDIO\`) specific to each country.

3) Be sure that you have added the following parameters to your
   experiment.py:

.. code:: python

   LANGUAGE = "DUT"  # lucid language code, not ISO language code
   COUNTRY = "NL"  # lucid country code, not always ISO country code
   LOCALE = "nl"  # ISO-2 code for experiment language
   LUCID_CONFIG_PATH = f"qualifications/lucid/lucid-{LANGUAGE}-{COUNTRY}.json"

4) Implement front-end confirmation of qualifications to ensure
   participant adherence to requirements and improve termination
   efficiency. Optionally, you can specify which qualifications to
   display and their order using additional arguments in the front-end
   confirmation code. Adjust and add the following code to your
   timeline.

.. code:: python

   verify_lucid_qualifications(
       LUCID_CONFIG_PATH,
       question_names=["TIMEOUT", "MONOLINGUALISM"],
   )

CINT: check & adjust quota
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After you deploy, go to `CINT
marketplace <https://auth.lucidhq.com/u/login/identifier?state=hKFo2SBEOHYxNU9ac25wQ3Y1ajlZSUhJX0gxcnF3eS1jSjFUU6Fur3VuaXZlcnNhbC1sb2dpbqN0aWTZIHBoMGRGTFdKMEoyQU9rRjAtaGtPWHRJMXdwQ2V2M3Zio2NpZNkgdFZ2aUpIUUc2VUV6dkw4Z3hwQVBoNG9jNWg5ajl6Z2o>`__
and log in to the group's account. You can find the credentials in the
`cap-safe <https://gitlab.com/computational-audition-lab/cap-safe>`__.

Also, save and open the link provided in the terminal after successful
deployment to `monitor <#monitoring-1>`__ the experiment. When you open
the link, you will see the dashboard. Here, click on the ‘Lucid’ tab to
access many features from the marketplace as well as the reports of the
experiment.

1) **Checking qualifications:** Here, click the “Qualifications” tab to
   check if the qualifications are set correctly. This will direct you
   to the official marketplace site.

   :width: 8.5in

.. image:: /_static/images/lab_deployments/image53.png
   :width: 8.5in

2) **Adjusting quota:** To manage the quota settings, go to the ‘Quota’
   tab. This will direct you to the official marketplace site.

.. image:: /_static/images/lab_deployments/image10.png
   :width: 8.5in

There are two types of calculations in CINT: completed and prescreens.
Completes are when a survey fills based on respondents that complete the
survey. Prescreens are when a survey fills based on respondents that
complete the Marketplace prescreener. By default, deployments are set to
'Completes.' However, it's advisable to consider switching to
'Prescreens' and setting a quota at the outset of your experiment. This
proactive measure helps prevent server overload, especially during
periods of high participant influx, which could otherwise lead to
experiment crashes. To implement this, navigate to the 'CALCULATION
TYPE' and switch to 'Prescreens.' Begin by setting a modest quota, such
as 10, then gradually adjust it based on experiment progression and
participant traffic. You can change it back to ‘Completes’ if the
experiment pace slows down.

.. image:: /_static/images/lab_deployments/image6.png
   :width: 8.5in

.. _monitoring-1:

Monitoring 
~~~~~~~~~~~

The new interface under the ‘Lucid’ tab in the dashboard offers a
variety of ways to monitor the experiment.

1. Check how many participants are working, terminated, and completed.
   It is important to inspect ‘Termination reasons’ as it might reveal
   if something is wrong with the experiment.

.. image:: /_static/images/lab_deployments/image46.png
   :width: 8.5in

2. Check the vital metrics of the experiment. Note that they are usually
   not optimized at the beginning of the experiment so you need to wait
   a little to see the realistic results:

-  **Conversion rate** gives the percentage of respondents who complete
   the study after exiting the Marketplace prescreener. To increase the
   conversion rate you can build quotas into the Marketplace to avoid
   client side over quotas. It should be higher than 10%.

-  **Dropoff rate** gives the percentage of respondents who passed the
   qualifications but did not return to the Marketplace. This should be
   less than 20%. If this is high you should look for possible setup
   errors i.e. routing, images/videos are displayed correctly

-  **Incidence rate** gives the percentage of respondents that will
   qualify for the study after qualification targeting. It is set to 66%
   by default on psynet lucid setting. You should aim for as high a
   number as possible. However, you can change it to a lower value if
   necessary. Use the bid_incidence parameter in the
   get_lucid_settings() to change it.

-  **EPC (Earnings Per Click)** measures the gross dollar amount a
   supplier can expect for each respondent they send into a survey,
   indicating whether the survey is appropriately priced. EPCs of $0.20
   - $0.30 are considered healthy, whereas EPCs below $0.15 will
   struggle to attract supplier traffic. Find more information
   `here <https://support.lucidhq.com/s/article/EPC-FAQ>`__.

   :width: 8.5in

3. Check how many participants enter the survey overtime on the
   ‘Respondents’ graph. If it is dying out, you may need to adjust the
   quota.

.. image:: /_static/images/lab_deployments/image11.png
   :width: 8.5in

4. Monitor participant status across survey pages by clicking on bars to
   access participant IDs and termination reasons. It is typical to have
   a high termination rate at the early stage of the experiment.

.. image:: /_static/images/lab_deployments/image4.png
   :width: 8.5in

5. Check completion LOI and termination LOI. The completion LOI should
   match your time estimate. Termination LOI should be low as much as
   possible. If it is higher than expected you should inspect for
   possible errors in your experiment.

.. image:: /_static/images/lab_deployments/image56.png
   :width: 8.5in

.. _section-13:

.. _termination-1:

Termination
~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you reach the desired number of participants, set it to ‘Complete’
and `export <exporting_and_terminating.html#export-data>`__ your data again. To destroy the app,
wait until there are no more working participants left in the
experiment.

.. image:: /_static/images/lab_deployments/image9.png
   :width: 8.5in

Reconciling participants
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If people are terminated for the wrong reasons or errors occurred in the
experiment, you need to reconcile your survey. Your survey must have the
status completed.

You can compensate with the following command:

.. code:: bash

   psynet lucid compensate SURVEY_NUMBER RID_1 RID_2 […] RID_N

You need to add all completed RIDs, **so also those that are already
marked as completed! Otherwise, already completed participants are
marked as terminated!**

Lab Recruiter 🔹 
----------------

The Group Manager (usually the experimenter) is responsible for setting
up and managing participant recruitment through Lab Recruiter. The
system provides full control over participant selection, experiment
access, and tracking.

Registering to the CAP Platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create an Admin account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  For now, please contact us at coco-experiments@cornell.edu to
      have your admin account created in the Lab Recruiter app.

Create a Group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  As the Group Manager, go to the Group tab and click **‘New**
      **Group’** to create a participant group.

.. image:: /_static/images/lab_deployments/image3.png
   :width: 8.5in

Set an Initial Test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  In your group settings, you can enable an "Initial Test Experiment"
      designed to verify device compatibility—including headphone
      functionality and audio quality. Participants must complete this
      test before accessing any actual experiments, ensuring they meet
      the necessary technical standards. If your experiments have
      additional requirements, please contact us for further assistance.

.. _setting-up-the-experiment-2:

Setting up the experiment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _experiment-costs-2:

Experiment costs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1) We typically pay 15 Euros per hour. So adjust the
      “\ **wage_per_hour**\ ” parameter in the config accordingly.

.. code:: python

   "wage_per_hour": 15

2) Make sure all time_estimates are set appropriately such that the
      overall duration of your experiment (you get from psynet estimate)
      matches your expectation.

3) Run psynet estimate in the terminal and note your estimated
      experiment duration and cost.

4) Check that the experiment costs are right:

-  Use your own data (and possibly but not mandatory the group data) to
   estimate how long it takes for each trial, pre-screeners, and the
   entire experiment

-  Start running (if possible) a small number of participants (e.g., 10)
   and try to see if your time estimate is wrong by more than 30% -
   redeploy.

-  If you had run the experiment, update the run time based on real
   data.

.. _experiment-script-2:

Experiment Script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case of assets, make sure you are not using DebugStorage, but
S3Storage or a LocalStorage.

Add config params under class Exp(psynet.experiment.Experiment) and set
recruiter as 'lab-recruiter':

.. code:: python

   config = {
       "recruiter": "lab-recruiter",
       "initial_recruitment_size": 5,
       "title": "Put your experiment title here (Chrome browser, ~XX mins)",
       "description": (
           "This is a speaking experiment that needs to be done in a quiet "
           "place WITHOUT headphones. You will be asked to imitate rhythms. "
           "The task will take about 15 minutes."
       ),
       "contact_email_on_error": "computational.audition@gmail.com",
       "organization_name": "Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics",
       "show_reward": False,
   }

An example for title:

“Check recorded texts (Chrome browser, Headphone required, ~10-15 mins)”

Example for description:

“In this experiment you will hear spoken sentences and need to judge the
quality of their transcript. The experiment requires Chrome browser and
Headphones and is intended for Native English speakers. It lasts 10-12
min.”
