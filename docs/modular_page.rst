Modular Pages
=============

Modular pages are a new way to implement pages in PsyNet.
They work by splitting page design into two main components:
the 'prompt', constituting the information or stimulus that is presented
to the listener, and the 'controls', constituting the participant's
way of responding to the information or stimulus.
