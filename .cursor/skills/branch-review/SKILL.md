# Branch Review

Use this skill when reviewing a PsyNet feature branch against the
open merge request's target.

Start by following `.cursor/skills/update-onto-target/SKILL.md` so
the reviewed tree is the real merge with the MR target. Then review.
Always update the GitLab merge request title and description. Do not
reorganize commits here; after an accepted review, tell the user to
run `/reorganize-onto-master`.

`/update-onto-target` remains a standalone command for when you need
the merge without a review. `/update-onto-master` is the same skill.

## Prerequisites

1. Verify you are not on the MR target:
   - `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
   - If that is `master` (or you already know it is the target), ask
     which feature branch to review.
2. Run `/update-onto-target`: read and follow
   `.cursor/skills/update-onto-target/SKILL.md` in full. Remember the
   target branch name it resolved. If that skill says the branch
   already contains the current target, continue. If it stops on a
   product-level conflict, stop this review too.
3. Confirm `origin/<target>` is now an ancestor of `HEAD` before
   scoping the diff.

## 1) Scope the change

The review scope is the committed branch diff in
`origin/<target>...HEAD`. Do not treat uncommitted local changes as
part of the branch review.

- `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` — confirm you are on the feature branch
- `git diff --name-status origin/<target>...HEAD`
- `git diff --stat origin/<target>...HEAD`
- `git status --short` — if non-empty, note that uncommitted work exists locally and was not included in the review

## 2) Inspect code diffs deeply

Review behavior-changing files first, especially core code and tests.

Check for:

- correctness bugs
- regressions
- breaking API behavior
- hidden side effects such as I/O, DB, network, or CLI changes

## 3) Validate test coverage

Behavior changes should typically be covered by tests, including:

- positive paths
- error paths
- edge cases

Look for missing tests around:

- mixed or invalid types
- empty or `None` values
- filename or path normalization
- platform-specific behavior

Avoid bloated tests, though: unless the area is particularly high risk,
recommend avoiding tests that are overly complex or long compared to the original code.

## 4) Refactoring opportunities

Flag:

- repetitive code
- mixed concerns in the same function or module
- unclear naming or missing docstrings
- dead code
- compatibility shims that may no longer be needed

## 5) Verification

- Run focused tests for changed areas when practical.
- If tests cannot run, say why and state the residual risk.

## 6) Report format

Present findings first, ordered by severity.

Use this structure:

1. Findings
2. Missing tests
3. Refactoring opportunities
4. Residual risks / assumptions

Keep summaries brief and make the primary feedback actionable.

## 7) Update the merge request

Always update the open merge request title and description to match the committed
branch diff. Do this even if the current title or description looks close.

- Find the MR: `glab mr view` or
  `glab api projects/PsyNetDev%2FPsyNet/merge_requests/<iid>`
  (find the IID with `glab mr list --source-branch <branch>` if needed).
- Title: a concise, accurate summary of the committed change.
- Description: follow `.gitlab/merge_request_templates/Default.md` and keep
  every section current (Motivation, Summary of changes, Behavior changes,
  Testing, Automatic code review). Compare each section against the reviewed
  diff. Look for stale claims: changes that were later reverted or reworked,
  CI/test statements that no longer hold, and new commits not yet reflected.
- Record that `/branch-review` was run in **Automatic code review**.
- If no merge request exists, say so and skip this step.

If the review is acceptable, tell the user to run
`/reorganize-onto-master` next so the accepted tree is recommitted in
logical units.
