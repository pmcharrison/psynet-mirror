# Implement PsyNet experiments

## Prerequisites

- Use the `explore-psynet-repository` skill before starting.
- Read `references/validation.md` before finalizing functional, interactive, or
  performance checks.
- Read `simulated-participants/SKILL.md` before designing multi-profile,
  stochastic, mock-LLM, or export-validation simulations.
- Read `produce-experiment-audit/references/populating-an-audit.md` for the
  audit population contract. Standalone experiments use nested `audit/` via
  `psynet audit init` (skill `produce-experiment-audit`).

Repository-specific wrapper skills may add extra conventions around planning or
review; do not invent workshop-only layouts in this skill.

## Preview links

When a temporary public preview is needed, use `prepare-experiment-tunnel`
(and `public-tunnel`).

## Steps

### Planning

The planning phase is responsible for turning the original natural-language specification into a detailed implementation plan.
The plan should be saved in `audit/PLAN.md` (required core audit section id `plan`).
Include the following sections:

#### Science (optional)

Decide whether to include this based on the prompt.
The section is most relevant if the prompt is asking specifically about
research questions, hypotheses, and the like.

#### Methods

This section should look something like methods sections in a scientific paper.
It should describe the experiment, including:

- Design: includes conditions, variables, randomizations.
- Materials: includes stimuli, questionnaires, etc.
- Procedures: includes participant workflow, trial structure, stimulus presentation, response collection.

Format in academic prose.

#### Implementation

This section focuses on the software implementation of the experiment, including:

- What PsyNet constructs to use (trials, trial makers, modules, etc.)
- The general shape of the timeline
- The strategy for generating the stimuli
- Any external dependencies

### Human review

Once the plan is complete, ask the human user to review it and provide feedback.
Only continue when they are happy.

You may skip waiting for human confirmation when doing infrastructure testing
or dogfooding the implementation/audit workflow itself; record that assumption
briefly in `audit/PLAN.md` or `audit/TIMELINE.md` and continue.

### Developing the experiment

#### Setup

Prefer **`psynet setup`** as the general-purpose route for creating and
refreshing experiment files and the constrained environment. Do not hand-write
boilerplate (`Dockerfile`, `test.py`, `.gitignore`, `docker/`, managed skills)
when setup/scaffold can produce it.

Canonical human docs: `~/PsyNet/docs/tutorials/creating_a_new_experiment.rst`
and `~/PsyNet/psynet/resources/experiment_scripts/AGENTS.md`.

**1. Choose a starting point**

- Prefer copying an authored PsyNet demo (or a prior experiment) into a new
  directory **outside** the PsyNet package tree (for example
  `~/psynet-experiments/<name>/` or a challenge `code/<experiment_slug>/`).
  Bundled demos ship authored files only (`experiment.py`, `requirements.txt`,
  assets); boilerplate and `constraints.txt` are intentionally omitted.
- Or start from an empty directory with a valid Python package name (not
  `code`, not names that cannot be imported).
- Use `explore-psynet-repository` to pick the closest demo before copying.

**2. Bootstrap, then run setup**

From the experiment directory:

```bash
git init   # if the folder is not already a Git repo (required for local debug)
uv venv --python 3.13
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install psynet          # thin bootstrap only
psynet setup                   # scaffolds files, pins, constraints, install
```

`psynet setup` is the default path: it creates missing boilerplate (including
`.cursor/skills/psynet/` when absent), pins PsyNet, ensures `constraints.txt`,
installs the experiment runtime (`psynet[experiment]`), and initializes Git when
needed. Use `psynet setup --docker` when the experiment will run in Docker mode
(file prep without local package sync; follow `docker/docs`).

**3. Editable local PsyNet (agents / contributors)**

When developing against an editable `~/PsyNet` checkout, keep a **dedicated**
experiment `.venv` (do not sync into `~/PsyNet/.venv`):

```bash
uv pip install -e ~/PsyNet
psynet setup --psynet-source editable
```

The initial editable install may be thin bootstrap only (`click`); `psynet setup`
rewrites `requirements.txt` to `-e file://...#egg=psynet[experiment]` and syncs
`constraints.txt` so the experiment runtime lands in the dedicated venv.

If setup already ran and you only need missing files later,
`psynet scripts scaffold` is enough. Use `psynet scripts update` only when you
intentionally want to refresh managed templates/skills from the installed
PsyNet. Do not treat `scripts update` as a substitute for first-time setup.

**4. After setup**

- Confirm `psynet --version`, then `psynet services ensure` (or let
  `psynet debug` / `psynet test local` ensure services).
- Launch with `psynet debug local` or validate with `psynet test local`.

#### Coding

- Build a minimal runnable experiment first, then add complexity.
- Develop front end and back end components as relevant,
  using the `develop-experiment-front-end` and `develop-experiment-back-end` skills.
- Add short comment where the PsyNet pattern is not obvious.
- Where possible, keep the implementation close to PsyNet's native style.
  Prefer built-in pages, controls, events, chatrooms, grouping, and timeline
  constructs over bespoke browser scripts. If custom JavaScript is unavoidable,
  keep it small, isolated, and justified by a requirement that PsyNet cannot
  express natively.
- For websocket or other live multi-participant interactions within one trial,
  use the `realtime-synchronous-experiments` skill alongside this general
  implementation workflow.

### Run simulations

Use `psynet simulate` to simulate participants and produce an example dataset.
This dataset should contain a decent number of participants representative of a real study;
adjust `Exp.test_n_bots` to ensure this. `psynet simulate` writes
`data/simulated_data/` (a directory). Zip it into the audit packet from the
experiment root:

```bash
zip -r audit/artifacts/simulated_data.zip data/simulated_data
```

Write into those audit paths from the first useful simulation onward; overwrite
interim exports rather than regenerating later for packaging.
For profile design, data-path parity, mock-LLM patterns, and simulation
limitations, follow `simulated-participants/SKILL.md`.

### Develop analysis scripts

Write scripts to analyze the generated data. Use a Jupyter notebook for this,
with the canonical filename `audit/analyses/analysis.ipynb`.
The notebook should be self-contained for review, including all code, tables,
and plots.
If the implementation is inspired by a published paper, replicate the analyses reported in the paper as closely as possible.

The analysis-notebook tooling is not part of the PsyNet editable install. Install
it into the PsyNet virtualenv before executing the notebook, and execute it
headlessly so its outputs are embedded for review:

```bash
uv pip install matplotlib jupyter nbconvert nbformat ipykernel
# nbconvert uses the notebook directory as cwd; resolve data paths from the
# experiment root (for example Path(__file__) is unavailable in notebooks—
# walk parents until experiment.py is found, or pass an absolute data path).

jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --inplace audit/analyses/analysis.ipynb
```

Keep the executed notebook small (many review tools truncate large inline file
content above ~100KB, which breaks notebook rendering): prefer low-DPI inline
figures (e.g. `plt.rcParams["figure.dpi"] = 50`) or link out large figures.

### Review

Review the outcomes of the previous steps and identify any serious issues that need to be addressed.
Return to previous steps if necessary to address these.

### Final report

Compile a final report of the experiment (`audit/REPORT.md`), summarizing the
process taken and any findings that arose. This is the core audit report section.
When a temporary public preview is needed, use `prepare-experiment-tunnel`.

### Completion gate

Do not treat an experiment implementation as complete until the simulation
export, canonical analysis notebook, and `audit/REPORT.md` are present, or until a
blocker for each missing artifact is recorded honestly:

- From the experiment root, update `audit/audit.json` (prefer
  `psynet audit mark-present <artifact_id>`) and record blockers in the audit
  packet. Validate and render with `psynet audit validate` / `psynet audit render`
  (auto-detects `./audit/`). See `produce-experiment-audit`.

Closing the audit packet is inventory and bookkeeping, not a second evidence
campaign. Do not re-run performance tests, simulations, or other expensive
checks solely because the audit skill checklist mentions them when review-ready
files already exist.
