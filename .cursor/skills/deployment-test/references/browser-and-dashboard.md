# Browser workflow and dashboard shortcuts


If the user gives an experiment URL, infer the app name from the first hostname segment:

```text
https://test-v13-3-0rc0-prolific-1.experiments1.cococo-lab.cornell.edu/
app name = test-v13-3-0rc0-prolific-1
```

Use the app name to filter Dozzle containers and to identify related logs.

## Browser Workflow

When using browser automation, launch a dedicated browser subagent for dashboard and Dozzle inspection when the task is more than a quick single-page lookup. First inspect current tabs, then navigate or reuse tabs.

1. Open the experiment URL and follow the experimenter dashboard link, or navigate directly to `<experiment-url>/dashboard/`.
2. Log into the PsyNet dashboard with the credentials provided by the user.
3. Verify the dashboard loads. Check the database pages, monitoring page, lifecycle/status pages, and any page the user reported as failing.
4. Open Dozzle at `https://logs.experiments1.cococo-lab.cornell.edu/`.
5. Log into Dozzle with the credentials provided by the user.
6. Search/filter containers by the inferred app name.
7. Inspect all matching containers, especially:
   - `<app>-web-1`
   - `<app>-worker-*`
   - `<app>-clock-*`
   - deployment or one-off launch containers if present

## Dashboard Shortcuts

- The participant table URL must use the fully qualified PsyNet participant polymorphic identity:
  - `<experiment-url>/dashboard/database?table=participant&polymorphic_identity=psynet.participant.Participant`
- Do not use `polymorphic_identity=None` for the `participant` table; it is not a valid dashboard URL for polymorphic participant rows and can produce a 500 from `get_mapped_class()`.
- The recruiter state table URL is:
  - `<experiment-url>/dashboard/database?table=recruiter_state&polymorphic_identity=None`
- When inspecting participant rows, change the page length dropdown to `100` first. If the visible table is still awkward to read, use the DataTables state from the browser console:

```javascript
(() => {
  const dt = window.jQuery("#database-table").DataTable();
  return {
    pageInfo: dt.page.info(),
    rows: dt.rows({ search: "applied" }).data().toArray(),
  };
})();
```

Important fields for the Prolific manual test are: `id`, `worker_id`, `assignment_id`, `hit_id`, `failed`, `failed_reason`, `status`, `complete`, `branch_log`, `failure_tags`, `base_payment`, `performance_reward`, `progress`, and `time_credit`.
