# Running instructions

There are various commands for running and interacting with PsyNet experiments.
Here is a quick summary:

```shell
bash docker/psynet debug local

bash docker/psynet export local

bash docker/psynet debug ssh
```

TODO - implement all of these! Would be great if we can expose all the PsyNet commands via this
one route.
