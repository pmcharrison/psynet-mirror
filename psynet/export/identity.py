"""Project identity and export-format compatibility checks.

Why this module exists
----------------------
An export can take a long time and produce many gigabytes. The most expensive
mistakes are cheap to detect first: running ``psynet export ssh`` from the wrong
experiment directory, or pointing a new client at a deployment whose export
format it cannot read. Both used to be discovered only after the transfer, or
not at all.

The deployed experiment answers a small authenticated preflight
(``/dashboard/export/preflight``) describing what it is; this module compares
that answer with the local experiment directory and decides whether to proceed.

Design constraints
------------------
* A wrong *experiment label* is almost always a wrong directory, so it blocks by
  default. A differing or dirty *Git commit* is common during development, so it
  only warns, and asks for confirmation when a terminal is attached.
* An unreadable ``export_format_version`` is a hard error: silently downloading
  an archive we cannot parse is worse than failing.
* PsyNet and Dallinger version differences are recorded, not enforced, for the
  canonical server-built export, because no local ORM or experiment code takes
  part in building it. The deprecated ``--legacy`` engine keeps the strict
  dependency checks, since it ingests into a local database.
* Old deployments predate the preflight endpoint. Missing identity is a warning
  plus a fallback, never a crash: the point is to protect experimenters from
  losing data, not to lock them out of it.
