"""Client-side export: preflight, transport choice, streamed download, publication.

Why this module exists
----------------------
The experimenter's machine used to obtain exports in two incompatible ways: it
either downloaded a complete archive into memory from the dashboard, or it
downloaded the raw database, wiped the local Postgres database, re-ingested the
data, and rebuilt the export locally. The first buffered whole multi-gigabyte
archives in RAM; the second was destructive and depended on local experiment
code matching the deployment exactly.

This module replaces both with a single client-side pipeline that never
executes experiment code and never touches a local database:

1. Ask the deployment who it is (:mod:`psynet.export.identity`).
2. Choose a transport: stream a complete server-built archive, or stream a small
   core snapshot and fetch only the asset bytes this machine is missing.
3. Extract into a staging directory beside the destination.
4. Validate, then publish atomically.

Design constraints
------------------
* **A failed export must never destroy a previous good one.** Nothing is moved
  at the destination until the new export is complete and validated. This is why
  publication is a separate, last step rather than "clear the directory, then
  fill it".
* **Downloads stream to disk.** ``response.content`` is never used, so client
  memory does not scale with archive size.
* **Incremental transfer is an optimization, never a requirement.** Any
  ineligible asset selection, missing digest, or absent ``rsync`` falls back to
  the complete archive, and says so.
* The asset cache is content-addressed, so re-exporting a deployment whose
  recordings have not changed transfers almost nothing.
