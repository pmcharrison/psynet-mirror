    <h1>Call for participants</h1>
    <p>
        The Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics is looking for online participants
        for a brief psychology experiment. In this study we want to understand how people express intentions with their
        voice. The only requirements are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You must be wearing <strong>headphones</strong>.</li>
        <li>You should be at least <strong>18 years old</strong>.</li>
        <li>You should be a <strong>fluent English speaker</strong>.</li>
        <li>You should be sitting in a <strong>quiet environment</strong>.</li>
        <li>You should use a google <strong>Chrome</strong> browser.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        During the experiment you can use a slider that allows you to change the voice of someone saying the word beer.
        Your task will be to change the slider so the word sounds like a suggestion or like a criticism.
        The task should take approximately <strong>{{ duration_minutes }} minutes</strong>,
        and you will be paid at a rate of <strong>&#36;{{ wage_per_hour }}</strong> per hour.
        This is broken down into a base payment of <strong>&#36;{{ base_payment }}</strong> and
        a bonus of <strong>&#36;{{ full_bonus }}</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The HIT will begin with a short screening test to check that you are using
        headphones and can hear properly (2 minutes).
        If you fail this screening test, the HIT will end,
        and you will only be eligible for the base payment.
    </p>
