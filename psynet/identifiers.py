"""Central definitions for participant and Lucid entrant identifier fields.

These fields identify a person to a recruiter or marketplace. The live
``Participant`` table (and ``LucidRID`` for Lucid ghost entrants) remain the
sole owners while an experiment runs. Export separates them into sidecar files
and writes pseudonyms into ``database.zip``.

``entry_information`` is included in the participant sidecar because it often
carries recruiter-specific signup metadata; it is blanked in the pseudonymous
database archive.
