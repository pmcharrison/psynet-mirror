        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>
            This research is being conducted by researchers at the
            Max-Planck-Institute for Empirical Aesthetics. In case of questions you
            can contact the researchers at <a href="mailto:{{contact_email_on_error}}">
            {{contact_email_on_error}}</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The purpose of this online form is to give you information to help you
            decide whether you want to take part in a research study. This online
            consent form includes the following information:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li> Purpose of the study</li>
            <li> Why the study is being done.</li>
            <li> The things that you will be asked to do if you are in the study.</li>
            <li> Any known risks involved.</li>
            <li> Any potential benefits.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Purpose</h2>

        The purpose of this project is to characterize internal representations in
        audition and vision. Specifically, we would like to understand how
        predictive mechanisms in perception rely on experience, learning and memory.
        We hope to use the judgments and interactions made by the experiment
        participants to infer the mechanisms of the auditory and visual systems. The
        long-term goals of this project are to understand how humans derive
        information from sound and vision, and potentially to help engineer machines
        that can replicate our abilities (e.g. in sound recognition and computer
        vision) and to help improve perceptual abilities in people whose hearing or
        sight is impaired.

        <h2>Procedure</h2>

        If you volunteer to participate in this study, you will be asked to perform
        simple tasks using your keyboard while listening to sounds, or while
        observing images or videos. For example, you may be asked to judge how
        pleasant a particular sound or an image is, or to categorize sounds or
        images (e.g., if a sound or an image is that of a car or a cow), or to judge
        other basic features of sounds or images (e.g., how frequently do you
        encounter this type of sound or image? how aesthetically pleasing you
        consider a particular sound or image?). The specific sounds, images, and
        videos used will vary, but may include: recordings of ambient sounds,
        noise-bursts, speech, music, simple tones, naturalistic images, animated
        images, comics, faces, objects, geometric shapes, fractal images, or videos
        of natural environments. The duration of the experiment is specified in the
        ad.

        <h2>Voluntary participation</h2>

        Your participation in this research is voluntary. You are free to refuse to
        take part, and you may stop taking part at any time. You are free to
        discontinue participation in this study at any time without penalty. The
        investigator may withdraw you from this research if circumstances arise
        which warrant doing so.

        <h2>Confidentiality</h2>

        No personal identifiers (e.g. your name or contact data) will be collected
        or used at any stage of the experiment. Thus, the experimental data is
        anonymous. We will also collect some demographic data (e.g. age, gender,
        country of residence) as well as information about your learning and
        exposure history (e.g. musical experience playing an instrument, years of
        formal education, languages spoken).

        All of the information we obtain during the research will be kept
        confidential. We will only save your anonymized Amazon’s Mechanical Turk IDs
        in our system, in order to distinguish participants who have already taken
        part on this or other experiments. MTurk worker IDs will not be used to
        derive your real identity, will not be shared with anyone outside of the
        research team and will be deleted after use.

        We will only share with collaborators demographic, aggregated or extracted
        data without personal identifiers (not indexed by Amazon’s Mechanical Turk
        IDs).

        <h2>
            Security
        </h2>

        <p>
            Data will be stored on desktops and laptops that have their hard disks
            encrypted using industry-standard encryption software. No data will be
            stored permanently on external servers. Theft of an individual
            laptop/desktop or stolen hard drive will yield no usable personal
            identifiers. All backup hard drives (Apple Time Machine, etc) will have
            encryption (FileVault2) enabled. All USB keys used for transporting
            protected data will be encrypted USB devices.
        </p>

        <h2>Risks / discomforts </h2>

        There are no risks for participating in this study beyond those associated
        with normal computer use.

        <h2>Benefits</h2>

        Although it may not directly benefit you, this study may benefit society by
        helping us understanding how humans derive information from sound and
        vision, and potentially to help engineer machines that can replicate our
        abilities (e.g. in sound recognition and computer vision) and to help
        improve perceptual abilities in people whose hearing or sight is impaired.

        <h2>Compensation</h2>

        If you satisfactorily complete the study, you will receive approximately
        &#36;{{ "{:.2f}".format(experiment.wage_per_hour) }} per hour to compensate you for your participation.
        In some cases, the experiment may finish early: this is not an error,
        and there is no need to write to us. In this case you will be paid in
        proportion to the amount of the experiment that you completed.

        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>

        Although researchers will not use your MTurk ID to derive your real
        identity, your MTurk ID could be linked to your Amazon public profile page
        if a data breach takes place. Thus, you may wish to restrict what
        information you choose to share publicly.

        <h2>Your rights</h2>

        You have the right to information regarding the data relating to you that is
        stored at the Max-Planck-Institute, the right to correct inaccurate data,
        and the right to demand the deletion of data in cases of inadmissible data
        storage and the right to data portability. You also have the right to submit
        an objection to the supervisory authority. For the Max-Planck-Society, this
        is the Bayerische Landesamt für Datenschutzaufsicht, Postfach 606, 91511
        Ansbach, Germany.

            <h4>In this particular experiment we need additional consent from you,
            regarding the use of audiovisual recordings.</h4>
        </p>

        <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>
            All the recordings we obtain during this research will be kept confidential,
            and nobody outside the group of researchers will be able to hear/see them.
            Your recordings will not be associated with your name or other identifiers in any way.
            Your recordings will not be used to derive your real identity, and they will not be made public.
            Raw audio/video will not be shared with collaborators (we will only share extracted data from
            recordings without personal identifiers).
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
            During data collection, audio-visual material will be recorded on a separate server and encrypted
            using strong encryption protocol (such as Advanced Encryption Standard).
            MTurk ID information will not be used to index this data.
        </p>

        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
            Although researchers will not use your recordings to derive your real identity,
            personal information could be leaked if you are not in an isolated environment.
            You may wish to make sure that no sounds/visual material in your environment
            could be linked to your personal information.
        </p>

        <h2> Consent </h2>
