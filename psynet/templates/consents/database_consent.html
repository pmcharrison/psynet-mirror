            <p>
                We store and process your data only for the purpose of initiating communication with you and for planning studies at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics (MPIEA). This data will never be shared with third parties.

            <p>

In addition, we save the date and time when you verified your email address. If we invite you to participate in a study, we will store the date and time of this communication. If you agree to participate, we also will store the date and time of your communication of this choice, and whether you completed the experiment successfully or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, before you participate in a study, you will be informed in detail about the procedure of the study and the collection of data during the study. Your consent to participate in a study will be obtained separately for each study you participate in.

            <h2>DURATION OF DATA STORAGE</h2>
            <p>
                Your data will be stored in the contact database for as long as the purpose of such storage, i.e., to contact you about participating in a study, remains in effect. You may request the deletion of your data at any time. To do so, send an e-mail with the subject “Delete” to <a href="mailto:cap-information@.ae.mpg.de">cap-information@.ae.mpg.de</a>
                Your personal data will then be deleted immediately.

            <p>
                You can also delete your data from the database by deleting your account (i.e., press "Delete account”  in the cap-recruiter log-in page). Note that all information, including the experiment and payment history will be removed from our database.

            <h2>PAYMENT AND COMPENSATION</h2>
            <p>
                We will not store any banking information or payment information in our system.  However we do store completion records and payment details of every task you completed. This information will be available for you to review it when you login to the database. Based on this information we allow you to receive payment via an external system such as PayPAL/WISE. It is your responsibility to make sure you can receive payment through this system and that you would want to consent to use it. This system supports transferring money to most banks around the world, please search your bank in their website to ensure that you will be able to receive payment prior to taking part in our experiments. We also recommend checking the term of service and it’s privacy statement and see if you consent to use their system for payment.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you cannot or would not like to receive payment via this system, we would not be able to pay you, however you can still participate in our experiments voluntarily, without payment. In this case you will not receive any compensation for your time.
