    <h1>Call for participants</h1>
    <p>
        The Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics is looking for online participants
        for a brief psychology experiment.
        In this study we want to understand people's internal representations of faces.
        The only requirements are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <!-- <li>You must be wearing <strong>headphones</strong>.</li> -->
        <li>You should be at least <strong>18 years old</strong>.</li>
        <li>You should be a <strong>fluent English speaker</strong>.</li>
        <li>You must have no problems with your <strong>colour vision</strong>.</li>
        <li>You should be sitting in a <strong>quiet environment</strong>.</li>
        <li>You should use a Google <strong>Chrome</strong> browser.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We estimate that the task should take approximately <strong><span id="duration_minutes"></span> minutes</strong>.
        Upon completion of the full task, you should receive a bonus of
        <strong>&#36;<span id="bonus_dollars"></span></strong> to
        <strong>&#36;<span id="bonus_dollars_inc_performance"></span></strong>
        depending on your performance in the task.
    </p>
    <p>
        In some cases, the experiment may finish early: this is not an error, and there is no need to write to us.
        In this case you will be paid in proportion to the amount of the experiment that you completed.
    </p>

        var experiment_metadata = null;
        window.addEventListener("load", function() {
            dallinger.get("/metadata").done(function(resp) {
                $("#duration_minutes").text((resp.duration_seconds / 60).toFixed(0));
                $("#wage_per_hour").text((resp.wage_per_hour).toFixed(2));
                $("#base_payment").text((resp.base_payment).toFixed(2));
                $("#bonus_dollars").text((resp.bonus_dollars).toFixed(2));
                $("#bonus_dollars_inc_performance").text((resp.bonus_dollars + 0.5).toFixed(2));
            });
        });

    <!-- <p>
        The HIT will begin with a short screening test to check that you are using
        headphones and can hear properly (2 minutes).
        If you fail this screening test, the HIT will end,
        and you will only be eligible for a small part of the bonus.
    </p> -->
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong>
        please make sure you are using an up-to-date version of Google Chrome
