# Changelog Fragments

Add one changelog fragment per change in this directory. The recommended
way to create one is:

```bash
psynet dev build-changelog --new <category> "<short description>"
```

This writes a uniquely-named fragment file containing your description as a
stub, which you then edit to the final entry.

## Filename format

`<YYYYMMDD-slug>.<category>.md`

The date prefix keeps fragments roughly chronological and the slug
differentiates same-day fragments. The `--new` helper creates this
format automatically and refuses to overwrite an existing file, so use a
more specific description if it complains. Hand-rolled fragment names
are valid only if they follow the same date-prefixed format.

Supported categories (rendered in this order):

- `breaking` → **Breaking Changes**
- `added` → **Added**
- `changed` → **Changed**
- `deprecated` → **Deprecated**
- `removed` → **Removed**
- `fixed` → **Fixed**
- `updated` → **Updated**
- `documentation` → **Documentation**

Fragment contents should be a single changelog entry in markdown without a
leading `-`.

Examples:

- `20260513-add-chatroom-demo.added.md`
- `20260513-fix-selenium-flake.fixed.md`
- `20260514-deprecate-old-helper.deprecated.md`

## Workflow

Contributors commit **only** the fragment file in their MR, never a
regenerated `CHANGELOG.md`. `CHANGELOG.md` is a generated artifact and
contains released sections only;
committing it from MRs would re-introduce the merge-conflict problem
that fragments are designed to prevent.

If you want to preview how your fragment will render, run the script
locally. It prints the rendered fragment sections to stdout and leaves
`CHANGELOG.md` unchanged:

```bash
psynet dev build-changelog
```

Maintainers cut a release from the current fragments with:

```bash
psynet dev build-changelog --release 13.2.0 2026-03-13
```

This inserts a new `## [13.2.0]` section and deletes the consumed
fragments. Beta and release-candidate versions also insert normal
versioned sections. Alpha versions (e.g. `13.2.0a0`) do not get
changelog release sections; keep fragments until the first release
candidate or stable release. Stable releases consume all matching beta
and release-candidate sections (e.g. `13.2.0b0`, `13.2.0rc1`) plus any
remaining fragments so the final release notes are complete.

## Direct pushes to `master`

The `changelog_check` CI job only runs on merge requests, so it cannot
catch missing fragments on direct pushes to `master`. If you push
directly to `master` (bypassing an MR), please still create a fragment
with the `--new` helper so the change appears in the next release notes.
Its date-prefixed filenames stay unique as long as slugs differ on the
same day.

## Migrated fragments

The historical in-progress changelog block was migrated into date-prefixed
fragments using commit-history dates and descriptive slugs. These remain
valid and will be consumed at the next release. Please use the `--new`
helper for all new fragments going forward.
