Experiment audits always live in ``./audit/`` under the experiment
directory. Run ``psynet audit`` from that experiment directory; commands take
no packet path and no ``--experiment`` option. Running from inside ``audit/``
is an error. ``--audit`` on simulate and performance-test is a boolean flag
that writes into ``./audit/``. Experiment source is the parent of ``audit/``;
leftover ``experiment.source_path`` and ``experiment.source_base`` fields are
ignored with a warning.
