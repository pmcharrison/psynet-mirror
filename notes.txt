Keep trials from failed participants?

Register different fail_participant routines for different phases/modules.
	In nonadaptive, there is an option whether or not to fail the participant’s trials, labelled “allow_partial_completes”. Note we override fail_participant so that it just fails their infos. Note also that there is a difference between failing people that fail a performance check and failing people who don't complete the experiment.
	In chain-based experiment, it doesn’t work if we do this, so we disable failing altogether. Instead, what about implementing trial-level quality checks?

RegisterRecruitCriterion
- provides a criterion that must be satisfied for recruitment to stop
- estimates how many more participants will be required to achieve that criterion, in addition to those already working

# TODO 

- implement debug route
- test propagate_failure_to_children # this is just for chain experiments 
- Implement recruitment criterion
- Implement trial-level quality checks


- redefine full?
