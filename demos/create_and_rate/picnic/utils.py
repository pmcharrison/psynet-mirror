                Let's say you are asked to guess a rule that describes the following examples:

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col text-success text-center p-3">

                            <span class="font-weight-bold">Here are items that are included (positive examples):</span>
                        </p>
                        maple tree, sunflower, bamboo
                    </div>
                    <div class="col text-danger text-center p-3">
                        <p>
                            <span class="font-weight-bold">Here are items that are excluded (negative examples):</span>
                        </p>
                        brick, basket, dog
                    </div>
                </div>

                You might guess that the rule is "<strong>only plants</strong>".

                An example for a bad guess would be "<strike><strong>only trees</strong></strike>", because it doesn't cover all the positive examples.
            </p>

            <h1>Rate Guesses</h1>
            <p>
                Let's say other players were asked to guess a rule that describes the following examples:
                <br>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col text-success text-center p-3">

                    </div>
                </div>

                The intended rule was: "<strong>only plants</strong>".
                <br>
                Players submitted the following guesses:
                <ul>

                    <li>Just Plants</li>
                </ul>

                You should check the guesses that are correct and uncheck the guesses that are incorrect, i.e.:
                 <div class="form-check">
                    <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" disabled>

                <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
                    <strong>Note:</strong> You are only rating if the meaning of the guessed rule matches the intended rule. You can ignore differences in spelling and phrasing.
