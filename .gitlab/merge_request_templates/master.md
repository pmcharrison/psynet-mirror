# Proposal
_What changes do you plan to make?_

# Predicted impact
_Why would the proposed contribution be useful to the PsyNet user base?_

# Predicted difficulty
## Technical bottlenecks
_What are the main technical bottlenecks/difficulties for implementing these changes?_

## Amount of code to be added/changed
_Very approximately, how many lines of code do you anticipated having to add/change?_ 

## Locality of code changes
_Will the revision change many parts of the PsyNet codebase,
or will it be restricted to a particular part, 
for example a given module or class definition?_

## Documentation requirements
_Does this change require updated documentation? If so, how much?_

## Implementation time
_Very approximately, how many working hours/days should it take to 
implement these changes?_

# Proposed reviewers

- Non-core reviewer: 
- Core reviewer:

**Note:**

- _Submissions from core developers (currently either Frank HÃ¶ger or Peter Harrison)
require only a core developer as reviewer._ 
- _Submissions from non-core developers require both a non-core and a core developer as reviewers,
unless agreed otherwise with a core developer.
The choice of non-core developer should be made prioritizing overlapping interests
where possible.___
