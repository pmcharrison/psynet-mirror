# Shared helpers for mounting the `benchmark-results` orphan branch as a
# git worktree. Source this from another script (do not run it directly).
#
# The caller must set:
#     RESULTS_DIR — absolute path where the worktree should live
#     BRANCH      — branch name to check out (typically "benchmark-results")
#     REMOTE      — remote name for ``fetch_branch`` (typically "origin")
#
# After ``attach_worktree``, ATTACHED=1 means this caller attached (or
# adopted) the worktree and is responsible for releasing it via
# ``detach_worktree``. ``detach_worktree`` runs ``git worktree remove``,
# which preserves the worktree if it has uncommitted changes (so failed
# benchmark runs leave their state behind for inspection).
#
# ``fetch_branch`` force-updates the local branch ref from the remote
# (the orphan branch is append-only in normal use, but ``+`` is defensive
# against history rewrites). Returns 0 if a fetch happened, 1 if the
# remote does not have the branch.
